# FreshWDL

FreshWDL is a lightweight, pure JavaScript alternative to WDL (which runs on Flash).
This allows for users to access it from nearly any device and platform.

Currently it is still simple, offering little customisability, but with interest and support will be able to go a long way!

See it in action at: http://www.goldenbaynzweather.info/wdl/freshwdl.html


## Setup
**Warning:** The following is not yet functioning, but will be very soon. This is simply in preperation.

1. Go to: [WD DOWNLOAD LINK], or download the FreshWDLmaster.html and config.js files from the master branch.
2. Adjust the config.js file in any text editor, changing that 'clientraw' file names to match the names you use (if needed).
3. Upload both the FreshWDLmaster.html page and the config.js page to **the same place as your clientraw files are uploaded to**.

You should now be good to go! Simply navigate to the FreshDWLmaster.html page in any web browser to see your new FreshWDL page up and running!

## Troubleshooting
#### (24 Hour) Graphs having strange straight line portions for 12 hours spans:
- Caused by the clientraw files uploading in 12 hour format. Adjust settings so that uploads are in 24 hour format.
